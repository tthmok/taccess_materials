Jordan, a 29-year-old autistic streamer, loves sharing his deep knowledge of astronomy with his Twitch audience. He hosts livestreams where he discusses astronomy news. His streams don't always attract a large audience. Still, he enjoys streaming because it gives him opportunities to chat with viewers.

One morning, Jordan begins his stream with the latest NASA rover news. He is excited to share, and he eagerly waits for viewers to join and engage. However, the viewer count remains low and the chat is unusually quiet. The lack of interaction starts to make Jordan feel uneasy and self-conscious. He's well-prepared to discuss various topics but feels unsure about continuing without audience engagement.

As minutes pass with minimal chat activity, Jordan finds himself struggling to keep up his enthusiasm. Although he manages to keep going, he can't shake off the feeling of speaking into a void. He wonders if he should try switching topics to something that the audience may be more interested in.
