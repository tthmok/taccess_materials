Emma, a 27-year-old autistic streamer, hosts relaxing streams focused on solving puzzles. Her streams are usually calm, and her community is typically supportive and respectful. One afternoon, while streaming she is focused on setting up her desk to work on a jigsaw puzzle. While intently focused on the task she doesn't notice an influx of new viewers. The new viewers drastically change the chat's tone and begin spamming off-topic and abusive messages, overwhelming Emma.
    
Feeling her anxiety rise and fearing a possible meltdown, Emma tries to regain control by hastily banning users. In her distressed state, she tells her chat she's going to be banning anyone who anything she considers off-topic. This leads to bans for some of her regular viewers as well. The chat devolves, and Emma struggles to communicate clearly, further escalating her stress. Unable to cope she ends the stream abruptly, leaving her community confused and worried.

Afterwards, Emma feels guilty and exhausted, concerned about the impact on her community.
