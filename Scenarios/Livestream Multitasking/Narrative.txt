Kim, an autistic streamer, has been broadcasting on Twitch for many years. Over time, their skill and passion for first-person shooter (FPS) games and unique sense of humor have attracted a large audience. 

During one gaming stream, Kim becomes deeply engrossed in a difficult battle. The chat buzzes with activity, but Kim's focus remains primarily on the gameplay. Although Kim is an experienced streamer, they still struggle with balancing attention between gameplay and viewer interaction. 
    
A viewer named Rachel sends a heartfelt message: ``I'm glad I found this stream. It's like a safe space for me.'' However, amidst the flurry of chat messages and Kim's concentration, the comment goes unnoticed. After defeating the enemy, Kim turns their attention to the chat and spots Rachel's message. They respond, ``That's great, Rachel. That means so much. It's why I stream.'' Unfortunately, by this time, Rachel has already left. Kim has mixed feelings. They worry that Rachel might have felt ignored. Yet, they also recognize the nature of stream chats, where viewers often come and go.
