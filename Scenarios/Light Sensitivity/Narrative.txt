Remy, a 32-year-old autistic individual, has found a sense of community on Twitch that they had never experienced before. Engaging deeply with both streamers and other audience members, they feel inspired to start their own stream, focusing on makeup tutorials---a special interest that they rarely discuss in person.

Determined to make their first stream successful, Remy invests in quality equipment based on advice from fellow streamers. However, they encounter a hurdle: achieving high-quality video generally involves bright lights pointed at the streamer. Remy is worried, as they can experience significant discomfort and even feel dizzy due to their sensitivity to light. Motivated by sharing their passion for makeup, they decide to try anyway.

During their first stream, everything initially goes well. However, after 30 minutes, the brightness becomes overwhelming, forcing Remy to dim the lights and pause the tutorial. While some viewers stay and offer support, others inevitably leave.
