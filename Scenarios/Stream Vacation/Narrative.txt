Alex, a 35-year-old autistic streamer, has been broadcasting their game programming on Twitch for three years, building a supportive community. Recently, Alex has been feeling overwhelmed by the pressures of maintaining their streaming schedule. They're experiencing fatigue and struggling to stream the amount of hours they normally do.

After a particularly draining stream, Alex realizes they need to step back from streaming, a ``vacation'' of sorts. However, the thought of leaving their community causes significant anxiety. They worry about disappointing viewers and losing the audience they've built up over time.

Alex wants to communicate their need for a break effectively, ensuring their community understands without feeling abandoned. They hope to find a way to stay connected with viewers during the break while also giving themselves the rest they need. As Alex considers how to approach this situation, they wonder how to balance their need for rest with their desire to eventually return to streaming in a manageable way.
