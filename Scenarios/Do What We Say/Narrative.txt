Joshua is a 42-year-old autistic livestreamer who loves role-playing games (RPGs). Recently, Joshua found a passion for speed running, a niche where people compete to finish games as quickly as possible. Since joining this community he has noticed his audience growing. 

One evening, Joshua decides to try a game he hasn't played before, ``Super Mario RPG,'' a classic title. Viewers are thrilled and the chat quickly fills with words of excitement. His spectators, eager to help, begin offering advice. The chat becomes filled with enthusiastic fans providing step-by-step instructions, commonly known as ``backseating.''

While Joshua appreciates the assistance he is also annoyed that the advice is taking away the fun of figuring out puzzles and at the demanding nature of some comments. Some viewers even begin to make sarcastic remarks making fun of the mistakes Joshua makes. These types of comments are commonly seen in more experienced speed runner streams where it is seen as a fun way to engage.

Joshua has mixed feelings: he is enjoying the increased viewership and active chat but is disappointed with the backseating.
